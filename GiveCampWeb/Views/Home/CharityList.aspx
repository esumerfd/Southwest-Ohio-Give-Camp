            <p>
                We have 300-400 inner-city, low income mostly African American youth, ages 14-24 who come to Elementz to find a safe place, and a place to engage in hip hop art forms:  DJ'ing, Dance, Graffiti Arts, Recording, and Emceeing (Rapping). We change lives and provide an alternate outcome for many who otherwise might be in prison or worse.

            <p>
                In this time of social media, Facebook and MySpace, organizations such as Elementz must focus on those mediums to connect to members and audiences. However, for the press and potential funders, not to mention parents, we have to have an updated website that accurately presents us to that world.  If we had a content manager and a simple website that addresses key issues of interest to the press and funders, we would be able to keep the website up-to-date and accurate for these key groups, while continuing to keep our primary social media sites updated (and these are already easy to maintain).

            We have been in existence since 2005 and recognize the need to have a central clearinghouse of information about this very new topic.  We want a place where families, colleges and school staff can go to learn about what college provide what services, help to maneuver the systems, skills to develop as the students are in high school, tips for parents and a place to share the stories of these "new" students that have never existed before.  Even one audited college course is a huge benefit for students!

            We desperately need a website to serve as a educational resource to the community. Currently, we do not have funding so we rely completely on volunteer leadership and support to  carry forth our mission.  We have incredible educators and trainers, but no one with technical capabilities to design a website.  Once a website is developed, we have several volunteer leaders who can update and manage the site.

            Although we have a small staff we rely on our volunteers to help with many things.  We track our volunteer hours and want to make this process easier on our volunteers and on ourselves.  We would love to have a spot on our website where volunteers could submit the dates, hours worked, type of work/specific project.  Maybe this info could be downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet for importing or to use as the basis for data entry work.
